## Class & Lab & Homework

Today while I am out, work on your homewok (most of it should be graded up to last night), then read through the resources here in the Gitbook.
I expect for you to have questions and a list of topics that you would like to review or that I need to finish writing here in the Gitbook.
Slack me these in a direct message.
