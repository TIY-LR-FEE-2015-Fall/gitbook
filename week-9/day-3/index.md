## Challenge

For this week we will be working on a weekly budgeting app.

* Users can...
  - **Register using Email and Password*
  - **Login using Email and Password (More on that tomorrow)*
  - Start budget for a week
  - Create a deposit
  - Create an expense
  - See if they are over budget for a week

## Data Modeling

### What Are We Storing

- Users
- Emails
- Passwords
- Expenses
- Budgets
- Deposits
- Dates/Timeframes
- Under/Over Budget

### Organize By Ownership

- User
  * email
  * password
  * Array of Budgets
    - Array of Expenses
    - Array of Deposits
    - Timeframe
      * Start Date
      * End Date
    - totalMoney
    - overUnder

## Standup

- David
  * What's good: Maybe going home for Christmas
  * What's bad: Not enough time
  * What's learning: Testing is very interesting. Starting to see why to test.
- Brandi
  * What's good: All Christmas shopping is done
  * What's bad: Hung up on an error saying "cannot find input class"
  * What's learning: Testing is great when you understand it. Knowing that things are functioning without having to see it every time is üëç
- Jeremy
  * What's good: Getting some sleep and exercise
  * What's bad: Haven't been able to do HW cause of errors (but that's fixed now... Maybe?)
  * What's learning: Testing is making more sense, but not all the way
- Ryan
  * What's good: Talking to people to make things easier to test
  * What's bad: There's a lot of times where I'm writing code where the test isn't really driven by my tests (ideally )
  * What's learning: Better, easier APIs
