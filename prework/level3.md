# Level 3

> **NOTE** I am currently still working on the prework for the fall class and recommendations and additional resources may change (shouldn't be too drastic).
> To stay up to date on any changes, [star this Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/book/rtablada/lr-fall-2015/details) and you will get a daily summary of all changes.
> You will will want this for class anyway as this will become a prime source for extra notes and review.

Most of this level reviews past content using Codeschool.
Codeschool adds video along with challenges (some of the videos can be a bit campy).
It is my preference for video along with coding challenges for the following materials, but if you do not have a Codeschool account, you can find the same lessons in Level 4 on Team Treehouse (which has a 14 Day Trial).
I recommend signing up for a month of Codeschool if you can swing it though since I think it really gives a good bang for your buck and you can cancel once class starts.

> Codeschool assumes that you have a code editor installed.
For now goto [`atom.io`](http://atom.io) and install Atom editor.
You can start working in project mode by going to a folder from the terminal and typing `atom .` to open the current folder in Atom editor.
